# PnP-Partner-Pack
Partner pack – Level set the partner ecosystem and customers on how to get started truly on the transformation and with typical SP add-in model implementations.
* Own repo as “PnP Partner Pack”
* Own version of the code, which uses PnP Core Nuget package
  * Only way we can ensure that code is stable enough and does compile
* Documentation and automated scripts for deployment
  * Step-by-Step guidance on how to setup apps to Office 365 tenant and Azure

#Implementations#
* Site Collection provisioning – Self-service site collection provisioning for typical collab sites
* Sub site provisioning – links above
* Some of the governance stuff for automated checks – WebJobs processing like classic timer jobs
* “Portal demo” with more significant branding elements with SP WCM – needed to get customers to Office 365, so that they can start using new-age portal stuff in the cloud with new models… now they are saying that they can’t move since their portal needs to have xyz, which does not exist.

#Value#
* Each partner would have starting point for their customizations
* Each partner would have ready to use demo based on PnP guidance
* Level setting community with the model
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Concentration on sufficient guidance on getting started – even idiots will learn how to use Office 365 and Azure together
=======
* Concentration on sufficient guidance on getting started as easily as possible for learning purposes
